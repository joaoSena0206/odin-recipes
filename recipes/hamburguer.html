    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically
        beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion,
        pickles, bacon, <br>
        or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce," often a variation of
        Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is
        called a <br> cheeseburger.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground chuck – We prefer an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for the juiciest burgers.</li>
        <li>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs – The best binders for juicy hamburgers. (Could be gluten-free!)</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce – Adds a deep beefy, smoky flavor.</li>
        <li>Egg – To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.</li>
        <li>Milk – The enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, or other spices of choice.</li>
    </ul>
