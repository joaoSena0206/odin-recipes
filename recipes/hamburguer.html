    <h1>Hamburger</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically
        beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion,
        pickles, bacon, <br>
        or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce," often a variation of
        Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is
        called a <br> cheeseburger.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground chuck – We prefer an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for the juiciest burgers.</li>
        <li>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs – The best binders for juicy hamburgers. (Could be gluten-free!)</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce – Adds a deep beefy, smoky flavor.</li>
        <li>Egg – To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.</li>
        <li>Milk – The enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, or other spices of choice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dump your ground meat into a bowl. (We go for ground meat with around 20% fat.) Season it with salt, pepper,
            and whatever else you want; you can add spices, perhaps, or Worcestershire sauce, or shallots, or chiles.
        </li>
        <li>Shape your burgers into patties, using your thumb to make an indentation in the center; this will keep the
            burgers from puffing up. Keep in mind that the burgers will shrink up a bit once you cook them, so make your
            patties a bit <br> bigger than you want them later.</li>
        <li>Oil your grill or a cast-iron pan, and grill or sear those patties. (How many times to flip them is up for
            debate -- but when I'm grilling, I flip once so I can get get those nice grill marks.) Cook them until your
            desired doneness <br> (around 125-130ºF for medium rare, around 1 minute per side for each inch of thickness).
            But before you take them off the grill...</li>
        <li>...add your cheese and toast your buns. Let the cheese melt while the burgers are still on the grill; to
            speed things up, you can close the cover.</li>
        <li>Once your burgers are finished cooking, and your cheese is melty and your buns are nicely charred, throw
            some condiments and toppings on those burgers. Anything goes. (Really, anything goes.) Bite into it and let
            those juices <br> run down your chin, and rejoice that it's summer. And then make another round, because now you
            know how.</li>
    </ol>
