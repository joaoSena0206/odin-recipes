    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically
        beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion,
        pickles, bacon, <br>
        or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce," often a variation of
        Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is
        called a <br> cheeseburger.</p>
